A study into Slick 3, reactive-streams and RxScala/RxJava

# Slick
> [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com) is a modern database query and access library for Scala. It allows you to work with stored data almost as if you were using Scala collections while at the same time giving you full control over when a database access happens and which data is transferred. You can write your database queries in Scala instead of SQL, thus profiting from the static checking, compile-time safety and compositionality of Scala. Slick features an extensible query compiler which can generate code for different backends. From version 3.0 and up, Slick is reactive and asynchronous. It has a lot of [new features](http://slick.typesafe.com/news/2015/04/29/slick-3.0.0-released.html) most notably: A new API for composing and executing database actions, support for the [Reactive Streams API](http://www.reactive-streams.org) for streaming results from the database and improved configuration of database connections via Typesafe Config, including built-in support for HikariCP.
